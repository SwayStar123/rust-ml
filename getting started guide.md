# Getting Started Guide
Here's the tools to give you everything you need to know to get started on this project. This is continued from the the README file (readme.md).

## Software
Rust - https://www.rust-lang.org

## Terminology
* backward propagation
  * other name - backpropagation
    * source - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation
  * The process of moving from the right to left i.e backward from the Output to the Input layer

* Softmax Activation Function
  * softmax - mathematical function that converts a vector of numbers into a vector of probabilities, where the probabilities of each value are proportional to the relative scale of each value in the vector.

    * softmax activation function
      * sigmoid - logistic - regardless of the input - it always outputs a value between 0 and 1 in the form of an S-shape between 0 and 1 with the vertical or middle of the “S” at 0.5.
        * source - https://machinelearningmastery.com/softmax-activation-function-with-python
* usize - The pointer-sized unsigned integer type. The size of this primitive is how many bytes it takes to reference any location in memory. For example, on a 32 bit target, this is 4 bytes and on a 64 bit target, this is 8 bytes.
  * source - https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.usize.html
* smart contract - programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary’s involvement or time loss. They can also automate a workflow, triggering the next action when conditions are met.
