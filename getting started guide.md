# Getting Started Guide
Here's the tools to give you everything you need to know to get started on this project. This is continued from the the README file (readme.md).

## Software
Rust - https://www.rust-lang.org

## Terminology
* backward propagation
  * other name - backpropagation
    * source - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation
  * The process of moving from the right to left i.e backward from the Output to the Input layer
    * source - https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/how-does-backward-propagation-work-in-neural-networks/
* Softmax Activation Function
  * softmax - mathematical function that converts a vector of numbers into a vector of probabilities, where the probabilities of each value are proportional to the relative scale of each value in the vector.
    * source - https://machinelearningmastery.com/softmax-activation-function-with-python/
    * softmax activation function
      * sigmoid - logistic - regardless of the input - it always outputs a value between 0 and 1 in the form of an S-shape between 0 and 1 with the vertical or middle of the “S” at 0.5.
        * source - https://machinelearningmastery.com/softmax-activation-function-with-python
* usize - The pointer-sized unsigned integer type. The size of this primitive is how many bytes it takes to reference any location in memory. For example, on a 32 bit target, this is 4 bytes and on a 64 bit target, this is 8 bytes.
