# Sway - smart contract language
Sway is a new computer language based off of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - forked from [mathletedev/rust-ml](https://github.com/mathletedev/rust-ml). This repository uses Sway to build a neural network from scratch without libraries to demonstration its capabilities.

## Background - personal project
* Non-funded
* created by the Discord user Sway#0727 - a vegan developer
* while this project isn't specifically about veganism - it's used to give vegans skills needed to produce vegan projects later down to the line.
  * i.e - will be used for activism one day
    * the fundamental framework computing language to build with and from.
