# Sway - Neural Network Project using Rust
Sway is a new computer language - a neural network one built from scratch without libraries. It's built off the computer language Rust.

## Background
This is an orginal repository forked from mathletedev/rust-ml (i.e. Rust's repo - https://github.com/mathletedev/rust-ml). 

This is a work in progress with struggles while building the code up due to the starting point. With time, it'll get up-to-date and running. Then it'll be streamlined to continue its progress until fully built.
