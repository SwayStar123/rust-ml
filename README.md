# Sway - Neural Network Project using Rust
Sway is a new computer language - a neural network one built from scratch without libraries. It's built off the computer language Rust. This project's purpose is a demonstration of capabilities.

## Background
* This is an orginal repository forked from mathletedev/rust-ml (i.e. Rust's repo - https://github.com/mathletedev/rust-ml). 
* This is an unpaid, personal project created by the Discord user Sway#0727 - a vegan developer (self-proclaimed 'vegan pilled')
  * while this project isn't specifically about veganism - it's used to give vegans skills needed to produce vegan projects later down to the line.
    * i.e - will be used for activism one day
      * the fundamental framework computing language to build with and from.
