# Work Backlog
backlog - an accumulation of something, especially uncompleted work or matters that need to be dealt with.
* source - Oxford Languages
* i.e. - this backlog is only of the issues. Another log (i.e. - updates) is for what got completed

## Background
This is a work in progress with struggles while building the code up due to the starting point. With time, it'll get up-to-date and running. Then it'll be streamlined to continue its progress until fully built.

## Timeline
### 12-10-22 (Sway) - no idea what's wrong - but something's wrong
* guessing - backwards propagation steps
